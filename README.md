# What is this?

Sometimes, some things just choose to stop to work. 

`But it was fine just now`, you keep telling yourself.

<br>

Your codebase refuses to compile. _Damn._

Your project starts to throw build errors. _Insane._

Your terminal continues to flip you off. _Rude._

You start to doubt your very sanity.

# And?

Felt the desire to keep a scrapbooks of sort for obscure solutions to miscellaneous miscellaneous.

Especially those that are not often-documented.

Hope this help with your nightless googling and stackoverflowing.

## Why?
Why not.
