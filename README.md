## What is this?

<br>
Sometimes, some things just choose to stop working. 

`But it was fine just now`, you keep telling yourself.

<br>

Your codebase refuses to compile. _Damn._

Your project starts to throw build errors. _Insane._

Your terminal continues to flip you off. _Rude._

You start to doubt your very sanity.

<br>
## And?

Felt the desire to keep a scrapbooks of sort for obscure solutions to miscellaneous miscellaneous.

Especially those that are not often-documented.<br/>Here, you will find useful error logs for your favourite searchbot to nomnom on.

Hope this help with your nightless googling and stackoverflowing.

## Why?
Why not.

## How?
Head over to [Issues](https://github.com/sogko/troubleshootdowns/issues) and peruse away.

## Can I?
Yeah, you definitely can. Just open an issue and be as descriptive as you can. (I insist.)

_Want repo access? Lemme know. I feel generous._

## Are you?
Nope, this is kinda like therapy, I guess.
